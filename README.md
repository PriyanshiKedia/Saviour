# Saviour
Saviour’ consists of a mobile application as well as website. Where, with the ease of access to the user’s location and information our system will show the nearest Blood bank, Hospital, or  #corona Center available. This makes it easy for the user to save time during emergencies. An app as such is required during situations like the one we are going through right now(COVID-19). To conclude our project everything required (especially during emergencies) under one simple click.

# Why we developed Saviours
In this world, where technology brings the world to our fingertips, even in the healthcare sector, especially during these circumstances where we have government verified mobile apps that help us to stay safe.

“Globally, as of 15 November 2020, there have been 53,507,282 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including1,305,164 deaths, reported to WHO.”

Lack of medical Information and misinformation are the major problems faced by the people. Due to which many lives are at risk. To overcome such problems, we came up with an idea to create a platform for users to get accurate and reliable medical information. Our system will display the information about the nearest Hospitals, Blood Banks, and Covid-19 centers to the users according to their requirements and Location with the help of Google Maps. The Authorized Blood Banks, Hospitals, and Covid-19 centers would update the information timely to deliver reliable information to the users which helps in saving many lives, especially during this pandemic period.

Among all the medical apps which are currently on the market only 11% of apps offer patients the most desirable functionalities. We will make sure that our app will be one of them.

# Technologies utilized:
To build our prototype application we have used flutter and connected it to a MongoDB database using Node.js as a back end for the app. We have also worked on the website which is built using CSS + HTML + JavaScript and connected it to Firebase.
